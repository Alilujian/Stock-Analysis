## Overview of Project
Steve and his parents are about to invest in green energy stocks. In this project, we will using VBA tool to analysis the stocks data and determine their daily volume and yearly returns in 2017 and 2018. Throughout this project, we will compare the refactored code and original code to see if the refactored code improve the code performance. By completing this project, I would learn the use of arrays, nested loop, and conditional formarting in VBA script.
